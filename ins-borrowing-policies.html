        <a name="1"></a><p style="font-weight:bold">What is Interlibrary Loan (ILL)?</p>
        <p>Interlibrary Loan (ILL) is a service for borrowing materials not owned by Crossett Library or Jennings Library. </p>
        <br>

        <a name="2"></a><p style="font-weight:bold">How much does ILL cost, and who can use it?</p>
        <p>The service is free to all current Bennington College students, faculty, and staff. All other patrons should contact their local public libraries, which usually provide ILL services for free or a small fee. </p>
        <br>

        <a name="3"></a><p style="font-weight:bold">How do I make an ILL request?</p>
        <p><a href="https://2977.account.worldcat.org/profile">Login</a> to the Interlibrary Loan system to make your requests.
        </p>
        <br>

        <a name="4"></a><p style="font-weight:bold">What kinds of material can I request?</p>
        <p>Books, films, music cds, journal articles, book chapters, microfilm, and other materials.
          <br>
          Alternatively, you may submit a purchase request for new items or any material that you’d like to see added to the Crossett collection by emailing library@bennington.edu or depositing your submission in the Library’s Suggestion Box. All suggestions will be considered.
        </p>
        <br>

        <a name="6"></a><p style="font-weight:bold">Are there any limitations to ILL?</p>
        <p>Materials not available for borrowing may include:
        </p><ul>
          <li>rare or fragile items, most reference-type books, genealogical materials, ebooks, computer files, and similar items;</li>
          <li>items owned by Crossett Library that are currently on reserve;</li>
          <li>required class reading listed on the Bennington College bookstore list; and</li>
          <li>items owned by Crossett Library that are currently checked out.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Please contact the <a href="mailto:illbnt@bennington.edu">ILL office</a> with questions or extenuating circumstances.
          <br>
          Items obtained through ILL cannot be placed on reserve. Faculty should send a new purchase request, with applicable course listing information, to kathyw@bennington.edu.
        </p>
        <br>

        <a name="7"></a><p style="font-weight:bold">How many items may I request?</p>
        <p>There is no maximum limit; however we ask that you limit your requests to a reasonable amount for your research.
        </p>
        <br>

        <a name="8"></a><p style="font-weight:bold">When will my ILL request arrive?</p>
        <p>Material is ordered within 1-2 business days of your initial request. Articles can take 1–3 days, and loans can take up to 7-10 days. The arrival time depends upon the location and swiftness of the owning library. Please utilize the “Comments” field of your request if material is needed quickly, or you have any other comments that might aid in the search for the request.
        </p>
        <br>

        <a name="9"></a><p style="font-weight:bold">Why do some items arrive later than others?</p>
        <p>Some items take longer due to the location of the owning library or because the material is difficult to locate and borrow, such as: newer items, entire periodical issues, certain reference books, textbooks, and maps. We make every effort to obtain your request, though the final decision lies with the owning library.
        </p>
        <br>

        <a name="10"></a><p style="font-weight:bold">How will I know that my ILL request is in? Where do I pick it up?</p>
        <p>All notifications are sent via email; please register your Bennington College email when you create your account. ILL items are kept behind the Circulation Desk at Crossett Library, and the person at the desk can help you.

          Articles and book chapters are usually sent electronically to your ILL account, where you can view and download the documents. <span style="font-weight:bold">Please save these files elsewhere (on a flash drive, personal desktop, etc.) when you first open them.</span>
        </p>
        <br>

        <a name="11"></a><p style="font-weight:bold">What is the loan period for my ILL item?</p>
        <p>The owning library selects the due date, usually 3–4 weeks, but the exact date will be on the paper band on your item. Recalled loans must be returned as soon as possible, in which case you may opt to reorder the item through ILL and we will request it from a different library.
        </p>
        <br>

        <a name="12"></a><p style="font-weight:bold">How do I renew my ILL item?</p>
        <p><a href="https://2977.account.worldcat.org/profile">Login</a> to the Interlibrary Loan system. You will see a listing of all current Interlibrary Loan items that you have checked out. If the item can be renewed, you will see a "Renew" button. Clicking this button initiates a renewal request; it is up to the lending library if they will grant a renewal, and for how long. We will email you the new extended due date.
        </p>
        <br>

        <a name="13"></a><p style="font-weight:bold">What are the fines for an overdue ILL item? For a damaged or lost ILL item?</p>
        <p>Late material is charged at $1.00 per day per item. If you have requested a renewal and are awaiting a response, you will not be charged in the meantime.
          <br>
          The replacement fine for a damaged or lost ILL item is at the discretion of the owning library. Patrons are responsible for all charges resulting from damaged or lost items and will be billed for any charges incurred.
        </p>
        <br>

        <a name="14"></a><p style="font-weight:bold">Who do I contact with additional questions about ILL?</p>
        <p>Please contact the ILL office at Crossett Library.
