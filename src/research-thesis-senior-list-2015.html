          <p>Economic and water management policies implemented under the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in over 50 years of political control over the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have played a hand in the large-scale degradation of Xinjiang’s environment, the shrinking of Xinjiang’s existing water resources, and increasing inequality and resentment between Xinjiang’s Uyghur and Han populations. Systematic water mismanagement, climate change, pollution and population growth through Han migration pose an imminent threat to China’s ambitious economic policies for Xinjiang, which have been heralded as a force for stabilizing the turbulent region. Though many improvements can and should be made within the current system, environmental improvements imply the need for genuine structural change including greater alignment between the goals of the local and central government, allowances for greater democratic participation, and transparency within the CCP. Taking steps to address inequality and inefficiency in Xinjiang’s water management could also mitigate ethnic tension and economic inequality between Han and Uyghur populations.</p>

          <p>The Stars Group (星星画会), an artist collective comprised of experimental painters and sculptors, were among those to lead the exploration of individual identity in modern China during a time of great economic development. While their success was short-lived, the Stars’ search for individual identity through art reveals shifting notions of nationality, democracy, and changing roles for artists in society. It is in the exploration of the personal narratives and work of influential artists Kang Keping, Huang Rui, and Ma Desheng that the changing relationships between Chinese citizens, the government, and the international community can be traced.</p>

          <p>An exploration through various Latino community outreach programs in Vermont colleges. Given the current state of immigration policy, which perpetuates a state of fear and unrest within the Latino (especially undocumented) community, it has been suggested that outreach programs, such as those organized by colleges, can help alleviate this stress. This study first looks at the history of immigration and the rise of the temporary undocumented worker in the United States, and then moves into dairy farming in Vermont. It profiles Bennington College's GANAS organization, which has been actively working to foster community and provide services to the Latino community, with an emphasis on migrant farmworkers who are in nearby dairy farms. Furthermore, in order to more closely analyze the GANAS model, the study also uses other Vermont colleges, including Middlebury College, Sterling College, and the University of Vermont as examples of other models of community engagement.</p>

          <p>Since the conquest of the West Bank of Jordan by Israeli Defense Forces in 1967, Israeli civilian settlement construction has grown exponentially. Oftentimes at odds with governmental institutions, the settlement movement proposes to settle the West Bank in order to complete the Zionist goals on which the State of Israel was founded. This thesis is an examination of the cross-institutional policies that enable settlement construction and expansion, and what this suggests of the larger political design of the country's foundations.</p>

          <p>Many education reform efforts have attempted to rethink the role of education in order to create a school environment that is more conducive to instruction outside of traditional academic learning. However, most of these reform efforts have failed because of the restrictive nature of school. There are culturally accepted school models embedded within the structure of the school that limit the possibilities of reform efforts. Through my research, I examine the case of a Vermont public high school that is rethinking the capacity of the school to meet the needs of the community by extending the range and accessibility of prevention services. Based on the analysis of interviews conducted at this high school, I argue that in order for these reform efforts to be successful, there must be increased opportunities for communication and collaboration amongst school personnel and with parents. The challenge is that in order for these dialogues to occur, and for systemic change to take shape, educational institutions must resist the model of schooling that is rooted at the core of the national school structure.</p>

          <p>Misgendering is the act of miscategorising an individual’s gender, and can happen to anyone regardless of their gender identity or physical appearance. This thesis seeks to provide insight into the lives of transgender and cisgender people concerning emotions and attitudes surrounding instances of being misgendered and of misgendering other people. It also attempts to shed light upon whether the biological sex at birth of a transgender-spectrum individual could impact how others respond to them.</p>

          <p>"The marginal illustrations in sixteenth-century books of hours, and specifically the Flemish book of hours,have been studied as precedents for both scientific observation and illusionistic still-life. However, the compositions of these borders are more complex than mere precedents to realism. The sixteenth-century Flemish book of hours is a book of illuminated ambiguity. The borders in the Ghent-Bruges manuscripts exist as a marker of the space between the viewer and the divine text or miniature. Thus, these borders serve as a medium which moves the viewer devotionally between these two spaces.
            Through the study of five manuscripts owned by the Morgan Library, and a facsimile edition of the Master of Mary of Burgundy Hours, this study argues that the juxtapositions between the realistic references and more fantastical or ambiguous imagery, both within the imagery and on the page itself, allowed a medieval viewer greater interpretive and imaginative freedom — an important part of medieval private devotion. These spatial ambiguities, in conjunction with the rigid structure of the text, were intentional pictorial devices which served simultaneously as a reminder of the quotidian and as a encouragement for a viewer to move into a devotional space beyond everyday concerns."</p>

            <p>The Man of Feeling was one of the purest manifestations of the Cult of Feeling in the history of the novel and was remarkably connected to the past in its style, tone, and narrative voice.  The ideas of the great novelists who came before Mackenzie, such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Miguel de Cervantes, and Samuel Richardson, can be seen in his work.  As a transitional piece of literature, The Man of Feeling¸ in combination with the works of Oliver Goldsmith, Tobias Smollett, and Frances Burney, shaped the next hundred years of English literature, making The Man of Feeling and Henry Mackenzie the missing links that connected the greats who came before him with those who followed.</p>

            <p>Autism or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is usually thought of as a behavioral and social communication impairment. However, it can also be described as a broad-based neurodevelopmental or brain-based disorder that is the result of genetic events that occur prior to birth with widespread effects on cognitive and socio-emotional development (Geschwind, 2009). This paper will explore how atypical neurodevelopment in individuals with ASD can lead to a wide range of differences in speaking, thinking, and remembering. I will look at different theories of cognition in the context of neurophysiological and behavioral disturbances in ASD. This paper will also try to conceptualize what cortical connectivity looks like in the autistic brain, and will question whether or not individuals with autism possess higher-order consciousness. Finally, I will touch on how autism is perceived in society, and what the implications of finding a “cure” for autism may be.c</p>

            <p>"Perhaps, Elizabeth Bishop’s “Questions of Travel” best introduces the premise of this collection-in-progress: “Think of the long trip home. / Should we have stayed at home and thought of here? / Where should we be today?” Bishop’s ultimate answer is that it would be a pity to not have heard or seen all the things along the way. The stories in this collection are my own attempt at answering these questions, as inhabiting a foreign environment gives characters an opportunity to make sense of themselves in a new context.

              In one of the stories, a young girl goes to her father’s house for the first time, whom she does not know well. She travels to his small farm in my native Brazil, where she struggles to connect with him and to navigate through his house and social life and is eventually rejected. The narrator feels the need to express her grief in a way that sheds light on her deep sense of loss, shame, and sadness. At times, her loss feels like something unspeakable (“I would be ashamed to let him see that I can't swim”). In another story, a couple moves in together only to find out that they don’t share any interests. These are stories narrated by characters who have left home in search of a better place that has been so built up in their minds that it has become unreal. I try to capture the mood first and foremost, the nature of the conflicted relationships, and the protagonists’ feelings of strangeness and discomfort."</p>

              <p>Concerns over the quinoa boom focus on the negative social and environmental consequences of the increased exportation of organic quinoa by Bolivian producers to markets in wealthier countries. These threats range from the increasing unaffordability of quinoa for Bolivians to the decline of traditional labour relationships in favour of wage labour, to declining soil health. However, interviews with Bolivians in the quinoa economy that I conducted this winter showed me that many of the negative consequences were overstated or more ambiguous than thought according to their experiences. Quinoa producers have developed an independent and empowered position through history and it is within their ability to deal with most of these consequences.To producers, the quinoa boom is useful not for the sake of the profits to be made.

              <p>This paper contends that state identity has played an important role in Mexico's war against drug trafficking organizations (DTO). It argues that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) altered Mexico's state identity, bringing it in line with the United States. This resulted in the construction of the DTOs as a threat to national security and confrontation as the only viable policy option. It concludes by expanding on the ways in which trade agreements can impact policies of national security.</p>

              <p>Literature Thesis: Grenadine Baker disappeared from Turning Point College in the spring of 1976. Her infamously mystifying case remained unsolved for years until her journal was found hidden in the performing arts building on Turning Point campus. In this journal was Grenadine's account of her final year on campus and her elaborate plans to fake her death. While this makes it clear that Grenadine willfully disappeared, her current whereabouts are unknown. This is the first published transcription of Grenadine Baker's journal, complete with exclusive information on her case and supplementary photographic materials.</p>

              <p>These stories explore the Bosnian word sevda—a sentiment untranslatable into English that refers to the ‘sweet soul pain’ that arises from suppressed emotion, action, or desire. For everything that is dormant, what is active in its place? How absurd are the realties we present, in comparison to what we really mean? The stories in the collection are hyper real, maximal, and alternate between hidden dialogues of human interaction and allegory.</p>

              <p>The goal of this research was to investigate a possible neuronal network of pathways activated in the alarm pheromone evoked cockroach escape response. Based on my results, I hypothesize that the response begins with activation of the sensory neurons, which then communicate with large neurons of the ventral nerve cord. These giant interneurons then communicate with motor neurons, inducing the escape response.</p>

              <p>With rapid global land use change and population growth, scientists are urged to find more effective strategies for biodiversity conservation. We require methodology that not only involves the protection of our ecological diversity but also provides the natural resources, ecosystem services, which the human species need. This study suggests that analog forests (forests managed for both food production and functional similarity to natural forests), even under fifteen years of age, provide similar ecological conservation potential to forest preserves in terms of bird species, family, and guild richness, as well as abundance. The two habitat types do vary significantly in their avian community composition and guild structure. This, thus, raises the question of whether certain species of birds are more important to target in conservation efforts than others. Older analog forest plots do, however, seem to support the same proportion of endemic bird species as preserve plots, which younger analog forest plots do not. This study argues that analog forest do indeed to possess conservation potential, especially when considering the additional benefits of ecosystem services valuable to human beings. Future studies should assess the additional economical conservation potential of this forestry strategy.</p>

              <p>In this research I examine the process of identity negotiation in international students at Bennington College. I argue that they negotiate their identities as transnational migrants who actively participate in the cultural and social lives of their host country and their home country. This process is further shaped by the presence of their peers in creating their social and community life, as well as their faculty and academic advisors who influence their academic experience. I question how international students negotiate their transnational identities from home and the US. How does a previous experience abroad, e.g. in an international school, affect this negotiation? How can the label “international” be a source of empowerment and safety space where students can share their experiences in a comfortable environment? I approached these questions through semi-structured interviews with thirteen first-year international students and one first-year American student.</p>

              <p>Sophocles stated "silence is the good order of women." But silence can have many meanings--a rejection or renunciation of thought, an attempt at a discourse beyond language, or a form of more truthful speech. Examining the films of Chantal Akerman, Claire Denis and Marguerite Duras, it becomes clear that the image of a silent woman is in fact much more disturbing than that of the woman speaking.</p>
