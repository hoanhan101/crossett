        <p>This study is a social psychological analysis of the experiences of physically disabled and/or chronically ill Pentecostals within divine healing practices, using three cases from Grace Church, a Charismatic church with three branches in New York City.  I find that faith in Jesus as Healer and compassionate community relationships create a foundation for successful physical or spiritual healing and renewed faith in one’s religious community.  In addition to semi-structured interviews and analysis of recorded sermons, I consult key books and journal articles emerging from the disability studies and disability theology movements, relevant Scriptures from the New King James Version, the Bible translation used at Grace, and texts authored by Emile Durkheim in order to demonstrate that the significance of divine healing practices extends past the walls of individual Pentecostal congregations.</p>

        <p>This critical thesis draws on literature, poetics, theory and gender studies to consider the autotheoretical work of Maggie Nelson alongside some of the sources referenced in her text The Argonauts (2015). From the introduction: "In this work, I consider Nelson’s writing, primarily her most recent text The Argonauts, alongside many of the critical sources cited within the text as well as others which help to illuminate the text’s concerns and how it goes about presenting them. My aims are to open up some of the threads of the text, to explicate the connections between Nelson’s work and her source material, to articulate some of my own readings, and to consider some of the many possibilities of how we might think about Nelson’s work and its contexts."</p>

        <p>Dans les films de la réalisatrice Chantal Akerman, on entre dans un espace qui, d’habitude, n’existe pas du tout dans le cinéma. Elle saisit des moments intimes silencieux qu’on n’a pas l’habitude de vivre qu’à domicile. Ses films tournent autour du passage du temps et des pensées au lieu des actions. Elle décentralise l’importance typique du corps humain pour montrer une perméabilité de l’œuvre qui permet au spectateur d’entrer dans ses films lui-même. Elle s’occupe de l’isolation qui existe dans les espaces intimes en plus des espaces publics. De plus, elle répond au rapport entre l’identité et l’espace qu’on occupe. Cette thèse va répondre aux idées et aux techniques précises qui créent toute une interrogation autour de l’identité et l’autorité artistique.</p>

        <p>The aim of this thesis is to show how space conditions political action. My work is situated in the Arendtian notion of action, which is to say that only through action, distinguished from labour and work, we become fully human and that is where freedom lies. While I agree with her notion of action in attempt to preserve political freedom, I will argue that it is important to ask where action takes place and how physicality of space impacts the production of action. There is a difference between a temple, a monumental palace and a sidewalk – all places where people can gather in the form of action and speech, and those different spatial arrangements reflect different power dynamics, fostering, encouraging or challenging political action. By under-theorizing the physicality of where action takes place, Arendt ignores the power of architecture to condition action. It is not to say that physical characteristics cannot be contested, but to ignore the influence of space and see it as neutral, misses an important point:  that our ability to act is conditioned by the material conditions around us. I will argue that space is both a ground upon which we act as well as an actor in some capacity. Therefore, if we are to maintain freedom, which can be achieved only through action, then recognizing the role of architecture in conditioning action is necessary if we are to further foster action.</p>

        <p>In 1997, as Botswana’s HIV/AIDS epidemic was nearing its peak, the small nation in the heart of Southern Africa was named the “AIDS Capital of the World”. Over 20 percent of a population of two million was infected and the life expectancy plummeted to an alarming 35 years of age. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, aid organizations infiltrated Botswana bringing with them programs that had been implemented in other parts of the world within varying populations. Mostly, these programs were modeled after those that were used among the homosexual community in New York City in the 1980s. Without regard for existing cultural values and frameworks, programs were put into place and campaigns such as the ABC (Abstain, Be Faithful, and Use a Condom) initiative were utilized. As messages were sent to abstain and use birth control, a sense of distrust and anger formed among Batswana, whose culture and religion placed immense value on reproduction. With a stronger understanding of Tswana culture and more collaboration with the Tswana people, programs could have been designed to fit in with the existing culture rather than work against it. Had this been the case, efforts would have translated more successfully and a larger impact would have been made.</p>

        <p>In the winter of 2017, California's most recent drought came to a calamitous end. The five years of dry, arid weather, were washed away with force by a season of extreme rain, wind, and flooding.  This thesis is located in the tension between the drought years, and the deluge ones— two distinct types of severe weather events that must be viewed as a cohesive “slow violence” (Nixon) if resources are to be effectively managed in the face of climate change. Two factors stood to dull the cacophony of this liminal space between severe weather events; first, California is a historically drought prone state. This history obfuscates the increasing violence of the droughts. Secondly, the winter storms were viewed in part as a relief of the multi year drought, and the floods were painted over in a positive light. I argue that this transition should not be seen as the relieving of a drought, but rather as a window into the larger process of climate change driven weather patterns, which is leading to increased resource scarcity in the region. This overarching weather pattern demands reflexive strategies of long term resource management. To formulate said strategies, I look towards two California communities, located in Mendocino County. The first, Mendocino, is an unincorporated community on the coast,  where the individualist attitude of the locals often clashes with their deep conservationist sentiments. Overarching this tension is the reality of the Mendocino City Community Services District (MCCSD) which controls the groundwater in town. The second community is Emerald Earth Ecovillage (EE) a small intentional community inland from Mendocino. In EE, resources are managed on a communal level, with water use consciously restricted, and considered as a community act. Taken together, these disparate strategies for resource management can be used to formulate the groundwork for a new theory of resource management, in light of climate change.</p>

        <p>Nietzsche’s account of friendship is an odd topic. Nietzsche’s remarks on friendship are scattered in aphorisms and asides in books devoted to grander topics. Rather than searching out unity in these many references to friendship and companionship, I attempt to elucidate them using Nietzsche’s more general philosophical views. I propose a reading that looks to Nietzsche’s perfectionism and perspectivism as explanatory and elucidatory concepts, and that friendship is a complex and continual process of cultivation. I first present an outline of friendship in Nietzsche’s writings. I then turn to an analysis of this perfective model; I argue that Nietzsche’s conception of the self begins as an incoherent tangle that needs to be made whole, sometimes analyzed in the call to “become who you are”. Drawing on Conant’s work on Nietzsche’s perfectionism, I show that perfection is not an end-state but an activity. I argue that friendship negotiates and celebrates difference, thereby allowing friends to work towards precisely this perfectionist outlook. Finally, I argue that the many ways that friendship is dealt with in Nietzsche’s work reflect the diverse ways that friendship can work upon an individual: the often contradictory treatments prescribed for friendships are actually in line with the perfectionist goal, and this can be supported by Nietzsche’s perspectivism.</p>

        <p>The Mexican Mural Movement was a pivotal movement in the slow creation of what is now relatively known as Chicanx Art. The movement, along with racial cases that occurred in Southern California, all of which date from the Mexican Mural Movement to the Civil Rights Movement, became a catalyst for the creation of the Chicano Civil Movement in Los Angeles, during the 1950s – 60s and brought forth influential activists: Carlos Almaraz, Charles “Chaz” Bojórquez, Melesio Casas, Frank Romero, Yreina Cervántez, and Patssi Valdez, some of whom are still unrecognized Chicanx artists who helped the Chicano Civil Movement through their art collectives and previously unpopular art techniques. These artists, along with the Chicanx Art Movement, are often forgotten, and seen as irrelevant, as both movements occurred during the same time. The Chicano Art Movement explored new methods of Chicanx Art as the Chicanx identity became prominent, and with it different forms of self-identification. These six artists broke barriers and stigmas within their own culture in terms of what is typically regarded as “Chicano Art” in the art community and have critically addressed issues that are relevant and continue to plague the Chicanx community. Through the exploration of the beginnings of what is now known as Chicanx Art and the use of social theories and analysis of the Chicanx identity, this thesis explores the different ways these six artists explore their cultural and social identities in their work, while critically debunking several stereotypes and addressing the complexity of Chicanx Art.</p>

        This thesis argues that, while many people see megachurches as inherently conservative institutions, the political activities they participate in are actually determined by the head pastor, who is tasked with defending the values of his church.</p>

        <p>Fables over the Phone is a translation of one of Gianni Rodari’s most treasured collections of adventures and discoveries in the field of “logica della fantasia,” or “fantasy logic.” They consist of stories born from grammatical errors and from the occasional clashing of words; they are, in short, concise verbal and linguistic games. Rodari’s collection can be considered “a manual for inventing stories” that challenges existing notions of narrative format and has been used to enrich literary dialogues with children since its publication in 1962. When asked how he intended his book to be read, Rodari responded: “First, in a family, I would like to arrive as a playmate, as someone who ignites a fire, who keeps a dialogue alive, who helps others look at the world and fall in love with life. In school I hope that my book will be an element of the discourse between student and teacher, like the first page of a book that they then have to write.”</p>

        <p>It is at times the difficult search for understanding of cultural identity that brings artists to a stronger understanding of themselves and their work; their fragmented discoveries merit consideration of how they are externally perceived by the culture in which they have come to exist or identify, of how they choose to internally interpret shifting cultural identity, and of how all of this can affect artistic practice. My analysis is therefore an exploration of displacement, an attempt to dismantle the internal struggle of the individual, specifically of artists who are either Italian immigrants or Italian-American and who have been physically or metaphorically displaced from their homeland. The argument considers artistic interpretation of cultural identity at a physical and emotional remove, and looks historically to failed nationalist art movements in Italy.</p>

        <p>The scientific study of the population of individuals with Antisocial Personality Disorder is largely monochromatic. Almost everyone who has been formally diagnosed is concentrated within criminal populations, creating a bias toward those affected as more liability than person, and restricting studies to personality factors such as manipulation, narcissism, and aggression. For this reason and others, a psychopath’s role in the world and their way of processing it is barely, if ever, covered in depth. The creativity of a person suffering from antisocial personality disorder, then, is already an excluded topic from scientific (although not necessarily popular) discussion. The formation of creative thought and the diagnostic criteria that shape and define the personality of a psychopath by no means dictate that the two are mutually exclusive. With a definition of creativity that includes all divergent thought without imposing value judgments on the process, applied divergent thought that provides an original and useful idea is common to all minds. However, due to flaws and oversights in the way that both creativity and psychopathy are studied, the creative psychopath is little more than a myth. The idea of malevolent creativity and the idea of a relatable, nuanced sociopath are both ones that repel the scientific community and attract the media. However, the fact that the topic is oft discussed but rarely operationalized points to this topic as one that CAN be studied, but for some reason, isn’t. The manifestation of the creative psychopath as a popularized yet unresearched myth illustrates methodological gaps in the field of psychology and limits the understanding of a very present phenomenon.</p>
