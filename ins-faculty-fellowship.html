        <p> Established in 2007 with generous support from the Mellon Foundation, the Faculty Library Fellowship is a competitively-awarded fellowship that provides one faculty member per year with a course release in order to develop a new course incorporating the resources and services of Crossett Library. The purpose of the fellowship is to enable the development of courses that integrate the opportunities offered by the library into course work in a significant way. Two specific outcomes are intended: first, that students develop a sophisticated understanding of the purpose and use of a library; and second, that students create projects and dialogues to both highlight and expand the role of Crossett Library within the Bennington College community. For guidelines on applying for the Library Fellowship, please refer to the Faculty Handbook. </p>

        <h4> <strong> Fellowship recipient: </strong> Erika Mijlin </h4>
        <h4> <strong> Course: </strong> Archive Fever </h4>
        <p> In this course students explore the creation, maintenance, and philosophical/social implications of digital archives. Important questions about history, power, memory, access, self-determination, and public and private spheres are addressed through reading and discussion. Projects include curating online exhibitions using collections in the <a href="https://crossettlibrary.dspacedirect.org/">Bennington College Digital Archive</a> and the open source publishing platform Omeka. </p>

        <br>
        <h4> <strong> Fellowship recipient: </strong> Mary Lum </h4>
        <h4> <strong> Course: </strong> Library City: A New Atlas for Crossett </h4>
        <p> In this course students inhabited the library as a 21st century city of knowledge. After introductory lectures and readings about contemporary cities and libraries, students spent the term mapping highly individual paths of research through the collections of Crossett Library. Intensive directed reading and looking resulted in the creation of written and visual essays through which relationships were built between a range of subjects and forms. </p>

        <br>
        <h4> <strong> Fellowship recipient: </strong> Ann Pibal </h4>
        <h4> <strong> Course: </strong> Context and Original Documents </h4>
        <p> In this multi-disciplinary studio seminar course, students read primary documents of art history —artists’ essays, letters and sketchbooks—while developing and representing their own self-defined studio projects. Students created visual presentations and conducted a significant research project using Crossett Library’s resources. </p>

        <br>
        <h4> <strong> Fellowship recipient: </strong> Nicholas Brooks </h4>
        <h4> <strong> Course: </strong> Sampling </h4>
        <p> Students in this course explored the past century’s love affair with technology, from the contraptions of the 1920s—the machine age—to the contemporary samplings of mash-ups, electronica, and hip-hop. Students considered issues of copyright, authorship, intellectual property, distribution, and appropriation through readings, assignments, and projects such as a mock trial. </p>

        <br>
        <h4> <strong> Fellowship recipient: </strong> Amie McClellan </h4>
        <h4> <strong> Course: </strong> Micro-Organisims, Macro-Science </h4>
        <p> In the context of a laboratory course exploring the contributions of microscopic model organisms, students studied the economic, institutional, and ethical issues related to open access scientific publishing. Students explored the challenges and opportunities of these issues through readings, assignments, and projects such as a debate. Students considered how, as future scientists, they might contribute to creating better information access. </p>

        <br>
        <h4> <strong> Fellowship recipient: </strong> Robert Ransick and Joe Holt </h4>
        <h4> <strong> Course: </strong> The Augmented Library: A Site-Specific Installation </h4>
        <p> In this year-long course, students used Crossett Library as the site for a creative exploration into how technology can enhance, augment, or change the dynamics of interacting with the architecture, information and occupants of the space. The class culminated in the creation of an installation called Bennington Bookmarks which encouraged visitors to explore areas of the library they may have previously overlooked and to share their ideas about the books and films. </p>
