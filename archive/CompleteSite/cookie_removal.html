<p>I have just put a cookie in your browser, so that the website traffic tracking software I have doesn't include your visits to the Crossett Library Website.  I am asking us all to have this cookie on our browser so that I can have the most accurate results possible for patron use of our website.  If you regularly clear your cookies from your browser, I humbly ask that you try to visit this page after each clearing, so that I can have the most accurate results possible.</p>

<p>This cookie will not affect your computer in anyway.  It merely acts as a badge for the tracking software- think of it as being on a guest list at a club- you get in without a cover charge.</p>

<p>Thanks so very much!  If you have any further questions, please contact me: <script>stumpIt("KBerry","?subject=analytics_tracking_cookie","KBerry@bennington.edu");</script> or by phone at extension 4601.</p>
