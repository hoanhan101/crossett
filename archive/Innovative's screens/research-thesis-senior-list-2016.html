            <p>In 2013 the majority party in Turkey implemented the strictest alcohol laws the nation had seen since the founding of the secular republic in 1923. The bill that was passed through parliament cited reasons of haram and public morality for these reforms. The public backlash claimed this law was both unconstitutional and ‘un-modern’, making alcohol a central contender in the ongoing debate of Turkey’s secular identity. This thesis argues that though the country has developed a collective identity that makes references to both the east and the west, it has never been able to bypass the boundaries of either. This has left the nation susceptible to authoritarian governmental systems and archaic modes of conducting its political and economic spheres. These alcohol reforms act as indicators that Turkey still engages with outdated strategies of control in its private sector and the success of the pushback movements serves as evidence that this modal of insular power is no longer sustainable in Turkey.</p>

            <p>In this paper I argue that the commitment of the author of the <span style="font-style:italic">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</span> to transcendental idealism is directly correlated to our reading of the notion of nonsense in the text. I first address the question: of whether Wittgenstein was or not implicitly committed to transcendental idealism when he wrote the <span style="font-style:italic">Tractatus</span>, based on A.W. Moore’s essay about the subject. Moore’s essay is structured as a back and forth conversation with Peter Sullivan in which both of them try to defend opposite answers to the question by using similar premises. Following this conversation between Moore and Sullivan, I argue that the fundamental reason why they disagree, even when they seem to be using the same premises, arises from their different treatment of the notion of nonsense within the <span style="font-style:italic">Tractatus</span>. After showing, through two applied examples, how the understanding of the <span style="font-style:italic">Tractatus</span> as being committed or not to transcendental idealism implies different conceptions of the notion of nonsense, I will then reverse the argument to show that depending on one’s reading of the notion of nonsense, one is, or is not, implicitly committed to a transcendental idealist reading of the <span style="font-style:italic">Tractatus</span> .</p>

            <p>Without green plants like trees to outnumber us, there would be no energy for human life on this planet.<br>

              I undertook a year-long, two-fold study, analyzing both ecological and molecular elements of Beech Bark Disease (BBD), an insect-fungal complex that has spread from Boston to Michigan and has been killing American Beech for over a century.<br>

              First I hypothesized that American Beech trees infected with BBD will enter tree hibernation (i.e. lose their leaves) earlier and faster than healthy beech. An alternative hypothesis would be that healthy beech would lose their leaves faster, since stressed trees will want to conserve energy for longer. During leaf-peeping, sick trees will leaf out later and slower than healthy trees. Examining differences in canopy duration and the length of the growing season (i.e. hibernation timing) is important, since differences can have cascading effects on the ecosystem, altering food availability and competitive dynamics for trees, insects, detritivores, and understory plants. <br>

              Secondly, I compared amounts of polyphenol-oxidase (PPO) between resistant and sick trees. PPO is an enzyme that has already been associated with plant defenses against pathogens in other studies. My hypothesis was that resistance will be correlated with higher amount of PPO. <br>

              For my tree-hibernation component, I found no evidence for the disease having an impact on either leaf-death or leaf-peeping. <br>

              For the lab part, due to time constraints and issues in the lab (like learning how to run a gel), I could not successfully replicate a protein extraction and Western Blot method to identify PPO levels in samples. Therefore, I have no results for my second hypothesis. The lab process was a good lesson in how vague language in published methods sections can make it difficult (if not impossible) to faithfully replicate other studies. It also taught me the patience and effort necessary to fine-tune a protocol that actually works.

            <p>This review is the product of one semester of reading primary microbiological research into human microbial communities, and building an understanding of how ecology can be applied to these communities. We created an ecological framework to address the process of microbial community assembly by bringing together ecological concepts from research we reviewed, and applied this ecological lens to the methods and findings of microbiological case studies. This paper addresses the development of the human microbiome from birth to adulthood by seeing how environmental changes like weaning can alter microbial communities in the infant gut, and by challenging the idea that succession is taking place during this period of human life. We also describe the characterizations of the adult microbiome, including the impacts disease, diet, and microbial diversity may have on community compositions. We discuss disturbance in this account to describe how community structure is impacted by change, using ecologically framed nuances like type and severity of disturbances, particularly as they apply to antibiotic “storm events.” We tackle the misuses of ecological terminology and the potential detriments this misapplication can have on research methodologies, questioning the assumption of stability found in many papers. Finally, we discuss possible future directions of research based on questions we developed through our research, focusing on the promise of functional analyses. An appendix including a glossary, annotated bibliography, our course syllabus and design is included at the end.

            <p>Improvisation is the act of creating novel material by responding to present stimuli. However simple it may be, its existence has confounded dancers, musicians, actors, and artists of the like. The product of improvisation is observable, but the genesis of the material is not. This paper explores how improvisation is composed through analyzing the psychological processes involved during the performance of an improvisation. In an attempt to better understand the unconscious mind of an improvising performer, empirical research of three Bennington College students, two musicians and one dancer, was conducted. Research consisted of improvisations followed by correlated interviews. Analyzing performed improvisations and post-reflective interviews of their experience is what made this paper possible.

            <p>First coined in 1979 by Dr. Dorothy Tennov as psychological term for lovesickness, limerence describes an involuntary state of cognitive obsession during which a person becomes compulsively preoccupied by romantic thoughts of another individual. In hopes of offering relief to the thousands still suffering from this understudied obsession, this paper presents revised perspectives on Tennov’s initial concept in order to consider how the lived experience of limerence has been influenced by recent advancements in digital communication systems and cyber-sociality. Findings taken from a period of participant observation implemented among a population of 42 members of an online support forum for suffering limerents are analyzed using ethnographic methodology to reveal new characteristics of both limerent experience and recovery. Finally, the established coping mechanism of No Contact is re-envisioned to align with these updates in cyber-social modes of communication. This study also makes recommendations for future research based on these findings.</p>

            <p>Henry James once said of War and Peace, “What do such large loose baggy monsters, with their queer elements of the accidental and the arbitrary, artistically mean?” One would expect nothing less from the author of such highly structured works as the perfectly hourglass shaped Ambassadors. However, I argue that while James might be unable to recognize a strict form of structure (according to his definition) in War and Peace, it is nevertheless present, though in a different form. The question then becomes: how does one best approach reading this text?  It is certainly structurally unusual and appears to have “elements of the accidental” that displease the reader searching for a more concrete form. However, upon close examination, there are aspects to War and Peace that create a structure (or a set of rules) for the text. Despite the novel dealing with the fates of nations, the internal and personal are never neglected. We go as far into the minds of Andrei Bolkonsky or Pierre Bezuhov as we do across the Russian countryside. Within this sea of places and characters, it is worth examining how the text retains its cohesion, through a close look at the structural elements of the work, which contribute significantly to this end.</p>

            <p>This thesis is an ethnographic study of the Svalbard Archipelago, an International Treaty Zone in the Arctic Ocean governed by Norway. Over seven months I collected data through participant observation and interviews to produce an analysis of the unique conditions that make human life possible in an extremely inhospitable environment. As climate change melts the Arctic, new resources become available and land that was once of limited utility due to the harsh environment becomes critical to extractive industry and the national economies it supports. In the resulting geopolitical fervor to negotiate ownership over Arctic territory, the residents of Svalbard find themselves at the critical point in Norway's claims to the North sea and the Archipelago itself. The result is a small, icy city of 1,500 with everything from a polar bear safe zone to a research university to a Thai restaurant, all paid for by the Norwegian state to ensure a strong lasting community in the territory they wish to maintain control of. By presenting the experiences of one small community in the Arctic I hope to add perspective and contemporary context to the longstanding question of Arctic sovereignty.</p>

            <p>The initial purpose of this thesis was to examine the influence that Jean-Jacques Rousseau had upon Leo Tolstoy, mainly in terms of examining how the two depicted their ideal form of humanity. However, while reflecting on how I came to read the two, and how in tune the two are with each other’s ideas (despite Tolstoy coming one hundred years after Rousseau; hence, Tolstoy read and admired Rousseau, but Rousseau could not have read him), it made more sense to place the two almost in dialogue with each other. The central theme--that of depicting humanity--remained, with subsidiary themes being nature, life, death, epistemology and experience. The two share a lot: ideas about nature’s spiritual and moral perfection, as well as the use as personal experience to form the basis of fictional experience. One of the more crucial aspects of the thesis was examining how both came to the conclusion that art must be communicative to all, and how that was achieved. Finally, the question that both asked was, what was the purpose of life, and how should one achieve that purpose? </p>

            <p>In my paper I have focused specifically on Adrian Piper’s “Food for the Spirit” (1971) ) as well as Hannah Wilke’s  “S.O.S.Starification Object Series (1974) as works that exemplify the relationship between artist and image, identity and performance, within the body of the photograph as its own distinct medium and practice. These works, I argue, successfully attempt to subvert notions of the Freudian dogma of ‘castration anxiety’ by reconciling a women’s ‘lack’ through their capacity as women to inhabit varying spaces of identities between themselves and their bodies. In these works Piper and Wilke typify a variation of roles: those of cultural associations to the female nude and gestures of the female body (Wilke) while also embodying the racialized and stereotyped black body (Piper) by exposing it to established ideological perceptions of the self and ‘other’. Here
              their bodies “bear visible signs of some of their identifications, markings that denote ‘otherness’ due to gender, ethnicity and race. Their use of their own bodies emphasizes the facts that the body is the site on which identity and identification are based and is the medium through which it is experienced” (Smith, 18). Thinking about the body as a site of signification allows one to also draw a parallel to the body as an image in itself, a self-contained display of visual markers.<br>
              The body’s image then becomes both a personal and universal archive of social and historical categories of belonging. The body as a signifier of difference but also that of resemblance to other bodies allows for a fragmented whole composed of various pieces that begin to construct more fluid notions of identity.</p>

              <p>The Dayton Peace Accords, drawn up in 1995 to end a three and half year war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, defined three constituent ethnic groups: Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs. Over 20 years later, Bosnia’s political institutions, education system, and population is largely divided along these ethnic lines. This thesis argues that while ethnicity in Bosnia is treated as a historically-rooted identity category and as embedded in society, the reality is that it is used situationally and instrumentally by individuals and the political élite for their respective self-interests. Defining the concept of ethnicity and the makeup of constituent ethnic groups is an ongoing process realized through the reciprocal relationship of individuals and their social groups. The findings of this research are presented through the narratives of several young adults, gathered through interviews conducted in the winter of 2016.</p>

              <p>In her long poem Primero sueño, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz uses silence as a theme to describe the boundaries of knowledge. In her prose letter Respuesta a Sor Filotea she protests the silencing of women in academia. In this thesis I argue that in both works Juana Inés employs silence to predicate human life in the unknown, just as the silent speaker is predicate to voice. Based on this, I question modern interpretations of her work as hyperbolizing the sacred through iteration and appropriation of patriarchal and imperial doctrine. With analyses of the Sueño and the Respuesta as well as El divino Narciso, I instead propose that Sor Juana's feminism is rooted in the Christian idea of the preeminence of justice before existence, including a study of Sor Juana's analogism as example.</p>

              <p>	This thesis is about better understanding sexist oppression though its roots in Sexual Dyadism and better understanding the complexities of intersecting oppressions when it comes to trans, Queer, and intersex people and identities.  Sexual Dyadism is the idea that there are only two, naturally absolute, and separate sexes.  I argue that Sexual Dyadism is a construct only loosely based on incomplete observations of human bodies and that it is the basis for western sexist and gender-based oppression; its destruction would end oppressive gender and sex as it currently exists in the United States and other western colonial powers.

              <p>In this paper, I argue that the definitions of thinness as a virtue in American culture perpetuate silence and stigma around the experience of those with eating disorders. The symptoms of eating disorders, which are detrimental to the health and well-being of those who suffer from the spectrum of eating disorders, are an extreme manifestation of these accepted behaviors. By placing eating disorders within a cultural context, we can clearly examine how the destructive goals and embodied practices within American culture blur the line between “health” and “illness”.  This multi-faceted cultural lens examines existing literature about the meaning and experience of bodies in American culture, both past and present. The goal of the following literature review is to explicitly connect the societal value placed upon bodies to the manifestation of eating disorders; additionally, the aim is to see stigma of eating disorders as an effect of long-standing cultural definitions of virtuous bodies.</p>

              <p>This thesis examines the efficacy of the Negotiated Settlement Agreement (NSA), also
                known as a consent decree, of Oakland, CA. I look specifically at Oakland and its
                Negotiated Settlement Agreement because in this moment where police brutality has
                become foregrounded in the national conversation it is important to scrutinize the
                existing mechanisms of reform. Oakland has had an active consent decree for over a
                decade and therefore is a very good case study on the efficacy of Negotiated Settlement
                Agreements, particularly looking at their effect (or non-effect) in the historical context of policing and race of the place itself. I analyze the NSA and its effects, examining what it has and hasn’t done and what it can’t do because of the limitations of its purview. Consent decrees don’t begin to address the structural issues of institutional racism that are embedded in all American institutions. NSAs not only don’t work but cannot work because they don’t address the root causes of differential policing and racialized police brutality. They don’t confront the structural violence and the institutional racism
                embedded in the structures of policing. There has been almost no previous analysis of the
                efficacy of consent decrees, even though they have been in use since the early 1990s and
                they are the only federal structure for police reform. I argue that the NSA is incapable of successfully addressing racialized police brutality because of the nature of the enterprise itself. The consent decree focuses on personal culpability rather than the systemic problems that are far larger than individual officers. My work shows that consent decrees are far less effective than they claim and that a serious re-evalaution of police reform is needed, incorporating frames of structural violence, institutional racism, and the historical and present context of race and policing of the particular place.</p>

                <p>This social history and political critique of space explores constructions of power, place, and identity in the past and present use of Pineland Center, Maine’s primary institution for people with developmental and mental disabilities. Pineland Center, originally called the Maine School for the Feebleminded, officially opened in 1908. For eighty-eight years, this large complex served as a hospital, school, research center and home— usually embodying many of these terms at once. The history of this particular institution represents a larger (often lacking) social history. These large institutions were responsible for thousands of people across the United States, and were often underfunded, understaffed and created by medical, political and social ideals that propounded segregation. Pineland was both created by and contributed to the American eugenics movement and the construction of ‘feeblemindedness.’ When the institution closed, over 30 buildings and 1,000 acres of the complex were transformed into Pineland Farms, a multi-use community center, working farm and business park. In the transformation from state institution to private business park, the history of Pineland Center was silenced, and serves as an example of the ways in which structures of oppression are first created and then upheld.The representation and commemoration of these silenced historic narratives are critical devices to analyze and deconstruct systems of oppression.

                <p>This thesis looks at the correlation between gender and the way individuals participate in and experience the underground music scene. I argue that, for women, gender is an obstacle in achieving success in underground music that is tantamount to that of their male counterparts, and looks at the way women work with and overcome this obstacle. My research is based in and around Brighton, a mid-sized New England city. Using data produced by interviews and observation, I seek to understand how musicians come to the scene, how they transition to performing, and their experiences as a performer and audience member. These questions are framed by patterns in data linking the relationship between music as an emotional outlet and the way performing builds confidence, how the dynamic between community and individuals shapes the scene, and similarities between the factors that musicians to play and perform.

                <p>My research addresses the experience of Tibetan Buddhist nuns in the Indian state of Himchal Pradesh as they transition from the self-perceived identity labels of lay-life through their education and practice of religious teachings and doctrine. While their attainment of non-self may only be possible upon their achievement of enlightenment, their progress through monastic environments allows them the means to shift their identity from that of their lives as laywomen into their recalibrated identities as nuns. Although my research lacks the longevity to fully address the nuns’ identity transitions, I have focused on several factors that are deeply influential for the nuns in furnishing this transition. By focusing on the nuns’ lived experiences, I frame identity as a self-defined entity that is flexible and necessitates deep fluidity in its construction. This fluidity is ultimately necessary for the nuns to achieve a release from selfhood. However, unlike the attainment of no-self, fluidity of identity is present at every stage of the nuns’ development—from laywoman to enlightened teacher. In addressing several points of altered self-perception as the nuns undergo this journey, I argue for the necessity of this fluidity as a tool for looking at identity construction and deconstruction on the path to enlightenment.</p>

                <p>The Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) was founded in 1954 with the goal to construct a series of 22 large dams and 19 hydroelectric power plants in nine provinces along the Syrian border in Turkey that are inhabited heavily by Kurds.  GAP no longer sustains a purely infrastructural goal; since 1989 it aims to reduce social and economic underdevelopment in southeastern Turkey.  The Ilısu Dam, which is a project of GAP, will submerge Hasankeyf, an ancient Kurdish town that dates to 10,000 BC, under 30 meters of water. Because GAP inundates thousands of archaeological sites of immense cultural significance, its plans are reminiscent of the village burnings and displacements that occurred in southeastern Turkey since 1991.  Since GAP dams “fully eradicate a culture and way of life,” human rights lawyers and architects accuse the government of “a crime against humanity” and “environmental and cultural genocide.”  This thesis examines the above accusations. It highlights the detrimental aspects of development, which are particularly evident in processes of resettlement of locals and relocation of archaeological monuments, in the specific case of the Ilısu Dam and how it further exacerbates the ongoing conflict between Turks and Kurds.</p>

                <p>Medicine as a cultural system constantly adapts to the changing needs and desires of
                  people. However, when cultures of medicine manifest as health systems negotiated between
                  scholars, professionals, and the public, the needs and desires of people are difficult to define. Accordingly, medical systems are divided in how they address public health. People, though, also have agency in what medicine they use, and it is not always one-dimensional. People’s health beliefs and the choices they make to improve their health defy expected systems of health care. While the infrastructures, policies, and philosophies of biomedicine and traditional medicine may be clearly delineated, people’s perceptions of them in regards to their own health are not necessarily so. This research aims to unfold how Mapuche people perceive health and how this aligns or doesn’t align with ascribed systems of biomedicine and traditional medicine, respectively. Since this task is hardly accomplishable in a direct manner given the historical and cultural complexity of this debate, mint is used as a case study in order to reveal current health perceptions, patterns, and paradigms of people. By following the use of this one herb that is used by both cultures, this research guides our understanding of how two sets of cultural practices might inform each other or find that they hold more similarities than might be expected. In light of concerns of medicinal cultural misappropriation and bioprospecting of medicinal plants, this research promotes the necessity for an actualization of our medicinal beliefs in order to clarify our goals in medicine.</p>

                  </a></p>
                  <p>Male <span style="font-style:italic">Betta splendens</span> (commonly known as Betta fish or Siamese Fighting Fish) intimidate rivals through aggressive displays that are highly dependent upon visual cues. Previous work done in this area has demonstrated the importance of some individual components of those cues in eliciting this behavioral response, such as color and movement. Most studies have handled these traits one or two at a time. Here, I aim to achieve a more nuanced understanding of the effect that these visual components have on the aggressive response by analyzing four traits - color, shape, texture, and movement - both alone and in combination to learn more about not only which traits are important, but how they compare to one another. Such work provides a better understanding of perception in these animals as well as valuable information that could be of use in future behavioral studies.

Kinship and Labor in the Production of Fair Trade Coffee</a></p>
                  <p>Since the beginning of the fair trade movement, there has been an emphasis on ethically produced, directly sourced, and environmentally sustainable products.  Fair trade standards and regulations are detailed and strict so they often dictate labor standards on fair trade coffee farms.  Additionally, due to fair trade’s problems and conundrums this work investigates the efficacy of the movement and the steps it can take to continue to generate change.  By looking critically at the labor required for fair trade and organic farming in Northern Peru, this thesis investigates the production of fair trade coffee and its dependence on family and community labor. </p>

                  <p>The transition from victim to perpetrator of child maltreatment is neither direct nor inevitable,
                    but rather is mediated by specific additional factors. The purpose of this review is to critically
                    discuss the existing empirical literature on the mediating factors of intergenerational child
                    maltreatment in order to provide the evidence needed to develop preventative services. The
                    findings indicate that parenting under 21 years of age, a history of mental illness or depression,
                    residing with a violent adult, poor parenting styles (both negative attributions/unrealistic
                    perceptions and poor quality of caregiving behavior), maternal aggressive response bias,
                    emotional dysregulation, and negative affect all play a mediating role in the cycle of
                    intergenerational child maltreatment. The four studies reviewed herein serve as a starting point in
                    understanding the cycle of intergenerational child abuse.</p>

Even with policy in place, the coastal Louisiana faces economic despair and the environmental crisis. This work considers how state and federal agencies bracket the cost of living with extractive industry by reviewing the scholarly literature on the resource curse, comparing the formal proposals made by key environmental policies after the BP oil spill with what restoration work has been implemented in coastal Louisiana, and considering the role of grassroots movements in enforcing state and corporate accountability after the spill.</p>

                    <p>Is the ecological destruction of mountaintop removal strip-mining violent beyond the possibility of description? Most documentaries, websites, and articles seeking to expose the enormous extent of harm done in the process display aerial images of a brutalized landscape. Others focus on the aesthetics of Appalachian poverty—now mistakenly assumed to be an inherited cultural fact that is made better or worse by the coal company rather than produced by it. We can only gather so much from the outside, even as we look down at Appalachia from capitol buildings, newsrooms, classrooms, and contraptions in the sky: and seeking to be pragmatic, to maintain our acceptable (and accepted) standards for environment, economy, and the employment of working-class bodies, we narrow the terms of debate around coal to an illusion of rationality. Yet the experiences of those who live, labor, and love at the site of toxic extraction are as untethered to market logics as mountaintop removal mining is to logic itself. Just as pollution is not merely an inert byproduct of profitable coal, neither are the communities who exist under and sometimes outside its institutional reign. This project will explore those harms committed by the industry in the Coal River Valley and the new worlds left in the fallout of coal, as well as the contradicting promises of corporations to both sacrifice and save the people there. However, this is a space for the marginalized and ignored voices of a resource colony to take precedent in their own stories. Using ethnographic research conducted through my own volunteer stays with the community organization Coal River Mountain Watch, I will rely on West Virginians’ oral testimonies, folk music, poems and storytelling, and accounts of the January 2014 MCHM chemical spill to provide a window into the real future of fossil fuels, while allowing for residents to determine their own fate.</p>

                    <p>The representation of women as people who need to be saved and protected

                      presumes that women are passive and do not take an active role. This project asks who is

                      thinking of women in this way, how the image of suffering is manifested, and for what

                      intent? This is not to neglect that women face serious injuries and violence during conflict,

                      it is to comprehensively identify ways in which the act of violence does not become a

                      landmark that shadows their capabilities. In exploring the fundamental approaches

                      towards women development in Rwanda, I will focus on four themes, 1) how the term

                      ‘empowerment’ is used to instantiate new forms of gender inequality, and 2) how the

                      representation of women forms an exoticized gender identity. Furthermore, this research

                      will examine the dynamics of, 3) the normalization of crisis by humanitarian agencies, and

                      4) the legacy of exclusion that is built through the use of stigma-laden titles such as ‘women

                      and poverty’ and ‘women and war’. In this research, I will investigate why women’s historic

                      role and present impact in community building is neglected in policy implementation and

                      media coverage by humanitarian initiatives.</p>

                      <p>The United States imprisons a higher rate of its population than any other country in the world. The costs of this punitive approach are growing, and the public safety returns are minimal. This report provides reviews of evidence-based policies that can be used to reduce Vermont’s criminal justice population without sacrificing safety. The policy suggestions offered are based on reviews of the scientific literature, and are tailored for the Vermont context. Driving while intoxicated crimes contribute to the prison population, and are a serious risk to public safety. Vermont should use ignition interlock devices (IID), an evidence-based tool that reduces recidivism for driving while intoxicated crimes. Second, Vermont should consider removing monetary bail, and continue to evaluate the ongoing Windham county electronic monitoring program in order to reduce the number of people held pretrial, a practice that harms the defendant, the public, and the corrections system. Most Vermonters under criminal justice supervision are in the probation and parole programs; the state should consider implementing a modified probation and parole system based on the examples laid out in this report in order to reduce costs and recidivism. Fourth, Vermont’s growing elderly prisoner population constitutes a very significant cost driver for the state. Vermont should consider implementing a system of compassionate release for elderly prisoners that do not pose a risk to the public. The suggestions for reforms in this report constitute only a small fraction of the important work ongoing to use evidence in search of a more perfect justice. It is the sincere hope of the Bennington College Incarceration Task Force that this report contributes to the ongoing dialogue within the state, and helps spur a new vision for criminal justice in Vermont.</p><br>

                        <p>Over 47 still life paintings in the Rijksmuseum and over 180 paintings catalogued in the
                          Netherlands Institute for Art History feature a singularly curious object: the nautilus cup. Despite
                          its designation as ‘cup,’ the nautilus cup is a purely nonutilitarian
                          object. The nautilus cup in

                          honored with a decorative pedestallike
                          stem. Though it also appears in other Northern European

                          <p>In contrast with some of the most prominent moral cosmopolitain theories of justice,
                            care ethics considers dependency as the essential feature of our humanity and designs an
                            account of morality based on it. Care ethics endorses an individual's situatedness and
                            particularity as essential characteristics, without which, it is argued, care could not be disbursed
                            effectively. Although care ethics provides interesting additions to the ethical discourse, ultimately
                            I argue that it is too narrow a theory to do the work required of it at the global level, and that it
                            can only function if supported by considerations of global justice. In this paper I focus on
                            applications of care ethics at the global level and attempt to articulate and justify a global duty
                            to care. Lastly, in order to further emphasize the necessity for care ethics to be incorporated
                            within a theory of global justice, I address and propose a solution to the challenges of
                            epistemological attentiveness that arise.</p>

                            <p>Model systems allow ecologists to test and demonstrate many generalized ecological principles. Archipelagos, elevation gradients, and abandoned fields are among the systems ecologists have recruited to establish analytical relationships of effects between  factors observable in many systems but often obscured by co-occuring effects. Serpentine soils, which are a relatively harsh soils typically found embedded in more typical soils, are host to a diverse floral community which has been used by researchers as a model evolutionary system. However, studying the influence of space on adaptation to Serpentine soils in situ is limited due to a limited range of patch configurations, particularly small isolated patches, or collections of small isolated patches. In order to test the effect of spatial features such as patch isoloation  and coverage on community assemblage as a general process, I constructed a mechanistic individual-based  simulation model. Within the model, establishment is competitive and plants vary in their ability to spread laterally across the landscape. Using this simplified model of a serpentine landscape, I test the influence of varying geometries of patches on community assemblage of randomly parameterized plants, and discuss the realism and limitations of the model as a tool for ecological theory.

The first is a report that analyzes several of the key problems facing the Sri Lankan education system today.
