<p class="pageMainAreaDivHeader">Introduction:</p>

<p>Writing makes everyone anxious, no matter how celebrated or experienced the writer is, and teaching writing can also present many challenges. While much of teaching writing involves sitting down and explaining the difference between the dash and the hyphen, much of it is also being responsive and imaginative in order to inspire students to find their way out of fear and into their strengths as writers.</p>

<p class="pageMainAreaDivHeader">Writing Repository</p>
<p>A <a href="http://libraryguides.bennington.edu/writingrepository/home">guide</a> for faculty containing writing exercises as well as grammar, Plan, and first-year reflection essay handouts.</p>

<p class="pageMainAreaDivHeader">Collaboration:</p>

<p>Camille Guthrie, the Director of Undergraduate Writing Initiatives, is available to work with you during each term, as well as over summer and FWT breaks, to support any aspect of teaching writing in your classes. She can collaborate with you to develop practices and assignments that help students become more critical, effective, and confident writers.
