<span class="pageMainAreaHeader">How to Read Call Numbers</span>

<p>Libraries use call numbers to group books together by subject. When a library uses call numbers to organize its books, researchers can browse the library's collection by subject areas such as psychology, history or music. Call numbers provide a unique "address" for every item within a library, so that once you understand the structure of call numbers, you can locate any item you are seeking. Because call numbers group items by subject, once you find one relevant item, you can browse the shelves around it to find other items on the same or similar subjects.</p>

<p>When you use our online catalog, your search results will give you lists of books and their respective call numbers. Crossett Library, like many academic libraries, uses Library of Congress classification for its call numbers.</p>

<p align="center"><i>Example</i>: LB 2395 .C65 1991</p>

<p>Read the first line in alphabetical order:</p>

<p>A, B, BF, C, D... L, LA,<b>LB</b>, LC, M, ML...</p>

<p>Read the second line as a whole number:</p>

<p>1, 2, 3, 45, 100, 101, 1000, 2000, <b>2395</b>, 2430...</p>

<p>The third line is a combination of a letter and numbers. Read the letter alphabetically. Read the number as a decimal, e.g.</p>

<p>.C65 = .65 .C724 = .724</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some call numbers have more than one combination letter-number line.</p>

<p>The last line is the year the book was published. Read in chronological order:</p>

<p>1985, 1991, 1992...</p>
