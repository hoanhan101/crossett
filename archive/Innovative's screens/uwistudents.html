<li class="li-number">How does Peer Tutoring work?</li>
	<ul class="bullet" >
	<li><span style="font-weight:bold">What happens during a writing consultation?</span> The student and tutor work together to develop writing and research skills at any stage of the draft process. Peer tutors will assist the student to evaluate the draft's strengths and the areas for improvement, and then teach various writing concepts to encourage a more critical, thorough, and realized work. Through conversation and example, the tutors will focus on the following aspects of any assignment: clarifying the student's thesis, finding persuasive evidence, structuring the essay, and basic instruction in grammar and style. Ownership of the essay's ideas and rhetoric remains with the student writer, as the tutor serves as a guide to help the student understand the many available writing choices and resources.</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:bold">What should I bring to a writing consultation?</span> Please bring a printed copy of the draft you'd like to discuss, a pen or pencil, and a copy of the assignment.</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:bold">What kinds of assignment can I bring to the tutors?</span> You can bring any kind of academic assignment: essays, lab reports, projects, Plan drafts, FWT cover letters, etc. While the Peer Writing & Research Tutors do not assist with creative writing, students may bring those pieces to discuss grammar and style.</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Why should I work with a Peer Writing & Research Tutor?</span> All writers can benefit from discussing their ideas with others. A Peer Writing & Research Tutor can help a student writer at any stage to develop complex ideas, clarify a thesis or argument, discover the most relevant research, restructure an essay, provide accurate citations, and improve grammar and style in the assignment.</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Who are the Peer Writing & Research Tutors?</span> They are Bennington students who have demonstrated exemplary writing skills, who do well academically, and who show an aptitude for teaching. Students whose work focuses in any discipline are eligible to apply.</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:bold">How can I become a Peer Writing & Research Tutor?</span> Peer Writing & Research Tutor and Student Manager applications are accepted each spring term for full-year positions in the coming academic year. Jobs are posted in WorkLink.</li>
	</ul>
