<span class="pageMainAreaHeader">Library Workshops</span><p></p>
<p>The library offers a range of services to help students expand their research skills and develop productive and lasting connections to the 
library. The library's offerings can vary greatly in scope and form, and are by no means limited to these possibilities. If you would like a research guide made for your class contact Joe Tucker <script>stumpIt("JTucker","?subject=workshop_request","JTucker@bennington.edu");</script> x4737, Jared Della Rocca <script>stumpIt("JDellarocca","?subject=workshop_request","JDellarocca@bennington.edu");</script> x4601. Here are some examples of services that faculty members have used in recent terms:</p>
<br /> 
<br />

<p class="pageMainAreaDivHeader">Library Instruction Sessions</p>
<p>Typically lasting about an hour, the standard library instruction session is designed to demonstrate the library's online databases, 
with students using laptop computers to try out search strategies along with the librarian. Some faculty members use this kind of session to get 
their students familiar with library resources generally, while others request that the librarian prepare a session that will prepare the students 
for a specific assignment. This session can be combined with a tour. 
<br />
With the increasing availability of smart classrooms and wireless access, the library can offer research instruction outside the library. 
Some faculty members have begun to request this option, especially for smaller classes, where the classroom environment may provide a more 
comfortable setting for dialogue.</p>
 
 <p class="pageMainAreaDivHeader">Individual Meetings</p>
<p>Faculty may direct students to schedule individual consultations with a librarian outside of class time. The one-on-one meeting format 
allows for personalized attention and gives the librarian a chance to explore questions in greater depth. Students benefit by developing an 
individual research relationship with a librarian. </p>

<p class="pageMainAreaDivHeader">Library Tours</p>
<p>Some faculty members have requested instruction sessions where the emphasis is not on electronic resources, but on books. 
Students who have attended these sessions often are pleasantly surprised to discover the reach and depth of the library's book collection, 
even when browsing serendipitously. Such a tour can be combined with a standard session of library instruction as desired. </p>

<p class="pageMainAreaDivHeader">Library-Related Assignments</p>
<p>The library has received positive feedback from faculty and students in response to assignments related to finding library materials 
or interacting with library personnel. Some faculty members have required students to browse specific areas of the library, or to check out 
books and bring them to class. Others have asked students to interview library staff members. It is worth noting that even students who use the 
library frequently can gain a new appreciation for the quality of library resources and services. One way to ensure that students do an adequate 
job of researching a topic is to require that a bibliography or research outline with sources be submitted before the research paper or project is 
due. Students can meet with a librarian at any time for assistance with identifying search terms, choosing databases or other sources, and 
selecting appropriate citation formats. </p>

<p class="pageMainAreaDivHeader">Special topics</p>
<p>Upon request, librarians can offer brief presentations on topics relevant to academic interests. These can be stand-alone offerings, or 
combined with other instruction as listed above. Some possible topics could include: plagiarism and how to avoid it; an explanation of scholarly 
publishing and the peer-review process; or a session devoted to WorldCat and borrowing materials through Interlibrary Loan.</p>
<br />

<p class="pageMainAreaDivHeader">Research Guides</p>
<p>Produced in collaboration with faculty members, an online research guide contains links to library resources applicable to the course 
content and assignments. These guides have lasting value as they can be used in subsequent terms and can be revised and easily updated as new 
resources become available. A research guide works well in conjunction with a library instruction session.</p>
