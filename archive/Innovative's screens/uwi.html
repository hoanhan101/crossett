<p class="pageMainAreaDivHeader"><a href="/screens/uwistudents.html">FOR STUDENTS:</a></p>

<p>The Peer Writing & Research Tutors assist Bennington students in developing their skills as academic writers and researchers. You may meet with the tutors to help you at any stage of the writing process&mdash;from planning an essay to searching for evidence to the final revision. The Peer Writing & Research Tutors work to support students as they examine their choices as writers and strive for clarity, cohesion, and style in their assignments. Through conversation and instruction, the tutors assist the process of generating strong ideas, thesis-making, integrating persuasive evidence, structuring essays, and learning grammar and style. </p>
<p>
Camille Guthrie, the Director of Undergraduate Writing Initiatives, is available to work with you during each term as well. She teaches three Scriptoriums, content-based essay-writing courses, during the academic year. She is available to meet with you during her open office hours.
