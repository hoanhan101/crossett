<p class="pageMainAreaHeader">Interlibrary Loan</p>

<p>Interlibrary loan (ILL) is the service that gives you access to the resources of other libraries. You can use ILL to borrow books, media, and to obtain PDFs of articles and book chapters. Crossett Library is moving to a new system to manage interlibrary loan. There is a <a href="https://2977.account.worldcat.org/profile">new user interface</a> for creating and managing requests. You will notice a few differences from our previous ILL system (ILLiad). The new service lists all of your requests on a single page, displays links to articles, and details the status of your requests and item due dates. You will still receive e-mail notifications about the status of your requests.</p>
<br />

<p style="font-weight:bold; color:ff000">***Everyone must create a new account to use the Interlibrary Loan system. No ILLiad accounts will transfer over.***</p>
<br />

<p>Creating your account:</p>

<ol style="margin-left:20px">
<li>1) Navigate to <a href="https://2977.account.worldcat.org/profile">your profile</a> (also, this is located at the same place on Crossett's website as our previous ILL system; in the Access box, click on Interlibrary Loan Account, and then click on Interlibrary Loan.)</li>
<li>2) Click the grey box that says “Don’t have an Account? Create Account.”</li>
<li>3) Please use your Bennington College email when registering. Your password must be at least 6 characters long and include a number.</li>
<li>4) Click “Create” when finished.</li>
<li>5) You will now be able to log in to the new ILL service.</li>
</ol>

<br />

<p>If you ever forget your password, do not create a new account.  Instead:</b>

<ol style="margin-left:20px">
<li>1) Navigate to <a href="https://2977.account.worldcat.org/profile">the Interlibrary Loan website.</a></li>
<li>2) Click “Set/reset password”.</li>
<li>3) Enter user name and submit.</li>
<li>4) Follow instructions received in email to reset password.</li>
</ol>

<br />

<p>We hope that this ILL service enhances your library experience and streamlines how you manage your Interlibrary Loan requests.
If you have any questions, please contact Kathy Williams at kathyw@bennington.edu or stop in at Crossett Library.</p>
