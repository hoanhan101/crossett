<p>
Established in 2007 with generous support from the Mellon Foundation, the Faculty Library Fellowship is a competitively-awarded fellowship that provides one faculty 
member per year with a course release in order to develop a new course incorporating the resources and services of Crossett Library. The purpose of the fellowship is 
to enable the development of courses that integrate the opportunities offered by the library into course work in a significant way. Two specific outcomes are 
intended: first, that students develop a sophisticated understanding of the purpose and use of a library; and second, that students create projects and dialogues to 
both highlight and expand the role of Crossett Library within the Bennington College community. For guidelines on applying for the Library Fellowship, please refer 
to the Faculty Handbook.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Fellowship recipient:</span> Erika Mijlin <br /> 
<span style="font-weight:bold">Course:</span> Archive Fever</p>
<p>
In this course students explore the creation, maintenance, and philosophical/social implications of digital archives. Important questions about history, power, 
memory, access, self-determination, and public and private spheres are addressed through reading and discussion. Projects include curating online exhibitions using 
collections in the <a href="https://crossettlibrary.dspacedirect.org/">Bennington College Digital Archive</a> and the open source publishing platform Omeka.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Course: Library City: A New Atlas for Crossett</p>
<p>
In this course students inhabited the library as a 21st century city of knowledge. After introductory lectures and readings about contemporary cities and libraries, 
students spent the term mapping highly individual paths of research through the collections of Crossett Library. Intensive directed reading and looking resulted in 
the creation of written and visual essays through which relationships were built between a range of subjects and forms.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Fellowship recipient:</span> Ann Pibal <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Course:</span> Context and Original Documents</p>
<p>
In this multi-disciplinary studio seminar course, students read primary documents of art history —artists’ essays, letters and sketchbooks—while developing and 
representing their own self-defined studio projects. Students created visual presentations and conducted a significant research project using Crossett Library’s 
resources.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Fellowship recipient:</span> Nicholas Brooks<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Course:</span> Sampling</p>
<p>
Students in this course explored the past century’s love affair with technology, from the contraptions of the 1920s—the machine age—to the contemporary samplings of 
mash-ups, electronica, and hip-hop. Students considered issues of copyright, authorship, intellectual property, distribution, and appropriation through readings, 
assignments, and projects such as a mock trial.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Fellowship recipient:</span> Amie McClellan<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Course:</span> Micro-Organisims, Macro-Science</p>
<p>
In the context of a laboratory course exploring the contributions of microscopic model organisms, students studied the economic, institutional, and ethical issues 
related to open access scientific publishing. Students explored the challenges and opportunities of these issues through readings, assignments, and projects such as 
a debate. Students considered how, as future scientists, they might contribute to creating better information access.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Fellowship recipients:</span> Robert Ransick and Joe Holt<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Course:</span> The Augmented Library: A Site-Specific Installation</p>
<p>
In this year-long course, students used Crossett Library as the site for a creative exploration into how technology can enhance, augment, or change the dynamics of 
interacting with the architecture, information and occupants of the space. The class culminated in the creation of an installation called Bennington Bookmarks which 
encouraged visitors to explore areas of the library they may have previously overlooked and to share their ideas about the books and films.
