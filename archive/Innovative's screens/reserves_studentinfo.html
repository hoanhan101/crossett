<a name="WhatsReserved"></a>
<p class="pageMainAreaDivHeader">How do I know what{u2019}s on Reserve?</p>
<p>Faculty who indicate that they have items on reserve have a course listing on-line, accessible by searching faculty or course name. </p>
<p>These items include:
<ul class="mainsite" style="margin-left: 50px">
<li alt=""><p>Print/Audio/Visual Crossett-owned and/or Faculty-owned personal copies of books, CDs, and films.</p></li>
<li alt=""><p>Ereserves: Electronic articles and MP3 files.</p></li>
</ul>
<a style="margin-left: 20px" href="/search/r">Search your course reserve items now</a>
<br />
<br />
<p>Printed course lists can also be found in the Reserve binder, which is held at the Circulation Desk.  Course lists are in alphabetical order by faculty surname.  Entries on course lists will include the item{u2019}s title, author, and call number. Physical items are kept behind the circulation desk. Tell the desk attendant which item you are looking for and show him/her the call number.</p>

<a name="illiad"></a>
<p class="pageMainAreaDivHeader">Can I use Interlibrary Loan to order an item that{u2019}s on reserve?</p>
<p>Interlibrary Loan may not be utilized to obtain copies of items on Reserve. These requests will be cancelled in ILLiad.</p> 
<p class="jump"><a href="#top">Back to the top</a></p>
<br />

<a name="LoanLength"></a>
<p class="pageMainAreaDivHeader">How long can I have the Reserve item?</p>
<p>Reserve items are limited to one book for 2 hours at a time (films for 4 hours) in-library-use only, after which the material should be returned to the circulation desk attendant or renewed for another 2 (or 4) hours. Sometimes more than one item can be checked out at a time, or for an extended period of time, if the faculty deems it necessary for the completion of assignments. </p>
<p>Reserve materials should be returned to the circulation desk attendant on duty to ensure prompt check-in.</p>
<p class="jump"><a href="#top">Back to the top</a></p>
<br />

<a name="ReserveHold"></a>
<p class="pageMainAreaDivHeader">What if the Reserve item I need is checked out to another person?</p>
<p>If the item is currently checked out to another patron, the reserve item may be held for an individual as soon as the previous patron{u2019}s 2-hour check-out period has ended. Alternatively, the policy for a Reserve Hold can be used if you{u2019}d like to check out an item at a later time (first thing in the morning, directly after class, etc.). Reserve material may be held for an individual for a specific time if a Reserve Hold slip is filled out in advance, but no more than 24 hours prior to that specific time.  A student may not reserve two consecutive time slots ahead of time. The Reserve Hold is forfeited if the patron is more than 15 minutes late in claiming the item at the specified time. </p>

<br />

<a name="Overnight"></a>
<p class="pageMainAreaDivHeader">Can I check out Reserves overnight?</p>
<p>Reserve materials do not leave the library unless checked out overnight (or unless special permission is granted from the instructor).  Certain materials (such as a faculty{u2019}s personal copies) may not be checked out overnight as per the faculty{u2019}s directions. A circulating overnight reserve item may be checked out one hour before the library closes. Overnight loans are due no later than one half-hour after the library opens the following day. (Monday through Friday by 9:00 am; Saturday and Sunday by 10:30am.)</p>
<p>Overnight reserves may be returned in the book depository located to the right of the front entrance for after-hours returns.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Overnight privileges may also be revoked after three late reserve returns.</p>
<p class="jump"><a href="#top">Back to the top</a></p>
<br />

<a name="ReserveFines"></a>
<p class="pageMainAreaDivHeader">How much are overdue Reserve fines?</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Overdue reserve fines are $1.00 per hour.</p>
<p>If a reserve item is more than 24 hours overdue, overnight reserve privileges are revoked for the remainder of the term, the instructor is notified that the material is not available, and the matter is referred to the Dean of Studies.  Overnight privileges may also be revoked after three late reserve returns.  Other privileges may also be revoked if necessary.</p>

<a name="Ereserves"></a>
<p class="pageMainAreaDivHeader">How do I access electronic PDFs and MP3 files?</p>
<ol class="mainsite" style="margin-left: 50px">
<li alt=""><p><a href="/search/r">Search your course reserve items now.</a></p></li>
<li alt=""><p>Locate your class listing and click the file you{u2019}d like to access. Before listening, you will reach the Media Verification page. You must type in your name as it appears on your Bennington College ID, the barcode on your ID, as well as the Course Password given to you by the course instructor. This extra step is essential to limit access for copyright purposes.</p></li>
