<p>To comply with copyright law, the faculty or Jennings Music Library must own a lawful copy of the CD. Please notify Susan Reiss <a href="mailto:susanr@bennington.edu">susanr@bennington.edu</a> in the Music Library if the CD used is your own. The music library will make a good-faith attempt to purchase a copy and add it to the collection.</p>

<p>We believe that access to a complete musical work is imperative to the teaching and learning experience. Therefore, we concur with the <a href="http://www.lib.jmu.edu/Org/MLA/Guidelines/Accepted%20Guidelines/Digital%20Reserves.aspx">Music Library Association{u2019}s (MLA) Statement on the Digital Transmission of Electronic Reserves</a>.</p>
<p>MLA{u2019}s statement refers to <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#110">Section 110 (1) of the Copyright Act of 1976</a>, which specifies that the following be permitted:</p>
<table align=center width="70%"><tr><td>Performance or display of a work by instructors or pupils in the course of face-to-face teaching activities of a nonprofit educational institution, in a classroom or similar place devoted to instruction, unless, in the case of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, the performance, or the display of individual images is given by means of a copy that was not lawfully made...and that the person responsible for the performance knew or had reason to believe was not lawfully made.
