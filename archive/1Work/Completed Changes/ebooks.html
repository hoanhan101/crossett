<p>When you conduct a search for books in the library catalog,
you may find that your search results contain some titles
that are listed as EBOOKS.  These selections will have the
words [electronic resource] after the book's main title.  These
e-books are electronic versions of the original print version of 
the book.  By adding e-books to its collection, Crossett Library 
can offer its readers access to many more titles than we could 
possibly house in our building.  Additional benefits of e-books are
24/7 online access and the ability to search the entire content
of a book.</p>

<p>You can locate e-books in the catalog by looking for the EBOOKS
designation on the right side of the results screen.  If you want to
find only e-books, you can do an advanced search and limit your
material type to e-books. </p>

<p>Ebrary contains over 24,000 full-text academic books.
In order to access Ebrary titles, you will need to download the free 
Ebrary reader.  This software only takes a few seconds to download,
and you do not need to re-start your computer, although you may need
to re-start your web browser.  For the Ebrary reader to display properly,
make sure that cookies are enabled and the pop-up blocker is turned
off on your web browser.  Please be patient when you open a book; sometimes it takes a long time for the Ebrary Reader to load.</p>
