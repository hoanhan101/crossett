<br />
<br />

<p>The citation of critical and primary texts that have helped to shape our thinking can be one of the great pleasures of scholarly writing. Our citation of sources, and the way we read and reason with them, is one of the ways in which we make good on our intellectual debts, keep the tradition alive, and the debate sharp, rigorous, and civil. Needless to say, not all texts are created equal. Poor sources will undermine even the most energetic, well-intentioned research.</p>
<br />
	
<p class="pageMainAreaDivHeader">Primary Sources</p>
<ul class="mainsite" style="margin-left: 50px;">
<li alt=""> Manuscripts, letters, historical and legal documents, works of literature, art, music, film all need to be cited. Some of these materials are now available on electronic data bases. </li>
</ul>	
<br />	

<p class="pageMainAreaDivHeader">Secondary Sources</p>
<ul class="mainsite" style="margin-left: 50px">
<li alt=""> Works of scholarship, commentary and literary criticism; journals, newspapers and magazines of record; books of nonfiction and journalism; websites and blogs of solid content and political, social and/or cultural significance.  </li>
<li alt=""> Wikipedia, for example, is not acceptable because the accuracy of its articles is not reliable.</li>
</ul>
<br />

<p>In conjunction with the Literature Faculty, the Reference Librarians at Crossett have compiled a list of basic print and electronic sources to aid you in your work. This list, provided below and also posted on the Library Website, will help you begin your research. It is not intended to be exhaustive. Individual Faculty members will have additional suggestions and requirements for specialized research. </p>

<p>If you should be in doubt about a source, take a moment to review the criteria outlined above. You should also:</p>
<ul class="mainsite" style="margin-left: 50px">
<li alt="">Do some research to determine if the source a point of reference for writers or scholars in its field.</li>
<li alt=""> Verify the bona fides of the publisher.</li>
<li alt="">Examine the bibliography of the work in question: does it meet the above criteria? </li>	
<li alt="">Check a few endnotes: Are they accurate? Cogent? Do they extend and/or refine the main discussion? If you determine that the bibliography and /or notes are weak, then you should eliminate the source. </li>
</ul>
<br />

<p>On the Library Website, you will also find a <a href="/screens/resguide_citation.html">Guide to Citation</a>, which outlines approved styles and practices of quotation, endnotes, and bibliography. It also sets out a definition of plagiarism, which is an intellectual crime, as well as a practice that can get you expelled from college. </p>

<p>Your research instincts will sharpen with practice. In the meantime, don{u2019}t hesitate to seek guidance from your professor or from a reference librarian.
