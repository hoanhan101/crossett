<p>Fill out a <a href="/screens/reserves_form.pdf">reserve form</a> two weeks prior to the start of term. Contact 
Kathy Williams <a href="mailto:KathyW@bennington.edu">KathyW@bennington.edu</a> x4605 if you have questions.</p>

<p>We will attempt to process reserve requests after the beginning of the term within two business days. Reserve requests received after 4:30pm Fridays will not be processed until 8:30am on the following Monday, or next business day. We will attempt to process, but cannot guarantee, rush or same-day reserve requests. </p>

<p>If two or more faculty members request the same item for reserve, both faculty members will receive a course listing in the Reserve binder, held at the circulation desk, which will include the title of the item. Course lists are listed in alphabetical order by faculty surname. Entries on course lists will include the item{u2019}s title, author, and call number. All available library copies will be placed on reserve. Typically, the library does not purchase duplicate copies, but this will be determined on a case-by-case basis. </p>
