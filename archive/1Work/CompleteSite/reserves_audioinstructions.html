<span class=pageMainAreaHeader>How to Use the Audio Course Reserves</span>

<p class=jump>Here is a <a href="/screens/reserves_audioinstructions.pdf">printer-friendly</a> PDF version of these instructions.</p>

<p>Welcome to the new streamlined method of sharing music listening assignments with your students.  There are two major steps in this process.  The first step is to copy the music from CDs into the computer (ripping) and encode them as MP3 files.  The second step is to copy the files from the music library computer to the Crossett Library server.</p>

<p>Before you start, you will need your Bennington College network ID and password.  This is the same information that you use when you check your e-mail via webmail, look at class listings online, etc.  Please contact Charlotte Welch <script>stumpIt("CWelch","?subject=Need_Network_ID/Password","CWelch@bennington.edu");</script> if you do not know your network ID or password.</p>

<p>You will also need to be on the list of approved users in order to log into the library server.  The current list of approved users is: 
<ul>
<li alt="">Kitty Brazelton</li>
<li alt="">Nick Brooke</li>
<li alt="">John Kirk</li>
<li alt="">Allen Shawn</li>
<li alt="">Bruce Williamson</li>
<li alt="">Robert Singley</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The entire process detailed below should be performed from the "Music Library" user account on the music library G4.  Susan Reiss will be able to log you in to this computer with the proper password.  Please log out of the computer when you are finished.</p>
 
<p><span class=pageMainAreaDivHeader>How to create MP3s:</span></p>

<ol>
<li alt=""><p>Open the Max application (on the dock at the bottom of the screen).</p></li>
<li alt=""><p>Insert the CD into the computer.</p></li>
<li alt=""><p>If the CD is a commercial release, Max should automatically show the title/artist/track names.  If they do not appear or they appear incorrectly, you may enter them yourself.</p></li>
</ol>

<table>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>
<p><b>FYI:</b><br>
The MP3 files that you create will be named in the following format:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="7">
<tr><td class=contactTD></td><td class=contactTD><b>Artist</b></td><td class=contactTD><b>DiscTitle</b></td><td class=contactTD><b>TrackTitle.mp3</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class=contactTD>For example,</td><td class=contactTD><i>Miles Davis</i></td><td class=contactTD><i>Kind of Blue</i></td><td class=contactTD><i>So What.mp3</i></td></tr>
</table>

<p>If you prefer another naming convention or wish to reflect the name of the composer, you may alter any of these fields.  For example, you could replace the disc artist{u2019}s name with the composer{u2019}s name.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>

<ol start="4">
<li alt=""><p>Click the checkboxes next to the tracks that you wish to encode.</p></li>
<li alt=""><p>Click on the {u201C}encode{u201D} button in the upper left-hand corner of the application.</p></li>
<li alt=""><p>Wait while the application rips the track(s) from the CD and encodes them as MP3s.  Read a magazine, drink some tea, etc.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><i>Repeat the above steps as necessary.</i></p>

<p>Close Max by clicking on the Max menu and choosing {u201C}Quit Max{u201D}</p>

<p><b>FYI:</b><br>
The MP3s that you just created are stored in the <b><i>{u201C}Course Reserve MP3{u201D}</i></b> folder on the desktop.  If you want to, you can open this folder to verify that all of your MP3s were successfully created.</p>

 
<p><span class=pageMainAreaDivHeader>How to upload the MP3 files to the Crossett Library server:</span></p>

<ol>
<li alt=""><p>While in the Finder (not an application), choose the {u201C}Go{u201D} menu</p></li>
<li alt=""><p>Choose {u201C}Connect to Server{u2026}{u201D} (at the bottom of the menu)</p></li>
<li alt=""><p>Choose smb://fp01/aud_reserves$ from the list of Favorite Servers</p></li>
<li alt=""><p>Click {u201C}Connect{u201D}</p></li>
<li alt=""><p>Enter your network ID and password</p></li>
</ol>

<p><i>You are now connected to the Audio Reserves folder on the Crossett server.</i></p>

<ol start="6">
<li alt=""><p>Open your user folder on the Crossett server.</p></li>
<li alt=""><p> If necessary, create a new folder for each class by selecting the File menu and choosing New Folder.</p></li>
<li alt=""><p>Open the Course Reserve MP3 folder on the desktop.</p></li>
<li alt=""><p>Locate the files that you wish to upload.</p></li>
<li alt=""><p>Drag them into the appropriate folder on the Crossett server.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><i>Repeat as necessary.</i></p>

<p>To log out of the Crossett server, drag the AUD_RESERVES$ icon from the desktop into the trash can.  The trash can will change to an eject symbol.</p>

<p>When finished, please tidy up after yourself by dragging your MP3s out of the Course Reserve MP3 folder and into the Course Reserves ALREADY UPLOADED folder.  This folder will periodically be cleared out, but serves as a backup in case something goes wrong on the Crossett server.</p>

<p>Log out of the computer by choosing {u201C}Log Out{u201D} from the Apple menu.</p>

<p>After successfully uploading your selection of MP3s, please e-mail Kathy <script>stumpIt("KathyW","?subject=reserves","KathyW@bennington.edu");</script> x4605 to alert her to the presence of new reserve material.<p>

<p>If you encounter any difficulties in this process, please contact Travis Garrison <script>stumpIt("tgarrison","?subject=audio_reserves_problems","tgarrison@bennington.edu");</script>.</p>
