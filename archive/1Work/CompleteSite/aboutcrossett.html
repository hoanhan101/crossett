<br />
<br />
 
<p>In 1959, the College opened the Edward Clark Crossett Library, designed by acclaimed architect Pietro Belluschi. The building was remarkable in that it was utterly modern-light and airy, with exterior lighting that lent the building a luminous nighttime glow-while still acknowledging the College's existing colonial architecture and intimate size. In an article praising the new library, Architectural Forum said:</p>

"In trying to bring the library into harmony with its colonial surroundings, the architects used three devices: first, they sited the building so that it fitted naturally into the pattern of rectangular spaces formed by the existing dormitories....Second, they used materials and details that recalled those of existing structures-white painted wood siding, horizontal wood louvers that relate to the clapboard patterns on the campus, vertical finds around the porch that recall colonial pilasters, brick and stone walls and paving that resemble similar details in neighboring structures. And, finally, the architects kept down the scale of the library so as to make it conform to the scale of the dormitories. This was done, partly, by sinking most of the bottom floor into the ground and making the building seem only two stories high, and partly by refining the details of wood trim and siding to maintain interest when the building is seen at close quarters. Bennington's President William Fels said of the new library: 'This is a warm, pleasant building. It doesn't intrude. The campus has gathered around it.' This was high praise indeed, but a leading library expert matched it, saying flatly that 'this is the best undergraduate library of its size in the country.'"</td></tr></table>

<p>Crossett Library went on to win the 1963 Honor Award for library design, given jointly by the American Institute of Architects, the American Library Association and the National Book Committee, Inc.</p>
