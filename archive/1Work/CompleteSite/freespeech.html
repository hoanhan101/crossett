<span class="pageMainAreaHeader">Free Speech Forum: WikiLeaks Edition</span><p></p>
<p><b>A lunchtime discussion group hosted by Crossett Library.  We sit down in the Dining Hall on four Thursdays at noon to discuss various free speech issues through the prism of WikiLeaks.  A basic understanding of WikiLeaks and the controversy its caused is all you need to participate!</b><br /><br />
<i>We're back on Thursday, April 21st at noon.  If you haven't participated before, now's a great time to start!</i></p> 

<p>Below is a summary of previous discussions, including a brief description of the week's topic, links to relevant articles, and interesting thoughts from the participants.</p>
<p><b>Define Journalism</b><br />
<i>3/10/11</i><br />
"According to <i>Time Magazine</i> WikiLeaks may become "as important a journalistic tool as the Freedom of Information Act." While <i>Time</i>
characterizes WikiLeaks as a tool for journalists, WikiLeaks has frequently called what it does as a form of "scientific journalism." What's the difference between scientific journalism and journalism? How do the answers to these questions impact questions surrounding WikiLeaks' ethical responsibilities?

<p>
<b>Various Remarks</b><br />
C: Assange calls himself "Editor-in-Chief" of WikiLeaks...can we properly assess WikiLeaks without understanding the motives of its editor?<br />
F: Scientific journalism is essentially true objectivity, providing the rawest data without any sense of spin...but are we losing a sense of narrative when we remove the "spin"?<br />
B1: WikiLeaks is the "roots of the journalistic tree"; is journalism built upon the roots, or is WikiLeaks and the stories based upon their data all part of one journalistic tree?<br />
B2: "Source brokers", such as newspapers, are intermediaries between sources and the public.  But are reporters taking their own "cut" and using sources as assets? <br />
B3: WikiLeaks is filling the gap in journalistic courage. Do journalists self-censor, and is WikiLeaks providing a service by giving it all to us? <br />
