<p>Bennington College students can borrow books and other materials from Crossett and Jennings Libraries. Generally, there is no set limit to the number of items that can be borrowed, with the exception of reserve materials. Your Bennington College ID card serves as your library card. Loan periods vary by material type; please consult the <a href="/screens/lib_fees.html">Library Loan Periods and Fines</a> page for more information. Extended loan periods may be available during Field Work Term and over the summer. Reference material, periodicals, and other non-circulating items may often be checked out with permission. Please ask the library staff if you are interested in checking out a non-circulating item. </p>
<p>
The library has PC and Mac laptops available for use in Crossett Library. They can be checked out for 3 hour periods within the library only. They can not be checked out overnight. Laptops may only be borrowed when someone on the regular (non-student) staff is available to check them out and receive them upon return: from opening until 6 p.m. Sundays through Thursdays; and until 2 p.m. on Fridays. Laptops are not available for loan on Saturdays. Students should be aware that anything saved to the laptop hard drive will be erased on a regular basis. While there is no renewal of laptop loans, students may check out another laptop immediately upon return if there is no other student waiting.
